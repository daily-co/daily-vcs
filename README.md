# Video Component System (VCS)

A video-oriented JavaScript graphics framework based on React, created by [Daily](https://daily.co).

This is a beta release of the VCS SDK so you can build custom components for use in live streaming and recording on Daily.

The VCS development toolchain and core library is in the `js` subdirectory.

Please see the [Daily Reference Docs](https://docs.daily.co/reference/vcs) for more information on VCS and its usage. Refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.daily.co/reference/vcs/installation) for instructions on running this project locally.
