# vcsrender

A lightweight video compositor command line utility.

Works as part of a rendering pipeline for Daily's VCS, [Video Component System](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-vcs).

Vcsrender loosely aims to follow the Unix philosophy of doing just one thing. It operates on text input and simple binary files. It only maintains internal state as an optimization, so you can restart a render job at any point. There are very few dependencies: vcsrender doesn't include video decoders or encoders or even the graphics state executor. You must run these as preprocessing steps.

To render a video with vcsrender, you need:

1. One or more input videos, provided as YUV sequences. There's a script `convert_movie_to_yuvseq.sh` which uses ffmpeg to convert known movie formats into the YUV sequence format for vcsrender.

NOTE: If your video inputs are edits on a timeline, you can use the "input timings" JSON format to describe them. See below under section "Rendering a cut".

2. Scene descriptions, provided as JSON sequences. These are a "baked" representation of the output from running a VCS composition. (The VCS composition is a stateful React program, so the baked scene descriptions are really a capture of the program's output over a given duration of video time.) You can produce these using the VCS batch runner, found in the [VCS core library](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-vcs).

(Side note about these sequence formats. The YUV sequences are dense - each frame must be provided. In contrast the scene description JSON sequences are sparse - you need only provide JSON data for frames where something actually changes. The VCS batch runner writes its output in this sparse format, so you don't need to think about this actively.)

Vcsrender output is in the YUV sequence format. You can then use the script `convert_yuvseq_to_movie.sh` to convert it into an MP4/H.264 file.

No audio processing is available. This is purely a video compositor. You could modify the `convert_yuvseq_to_movie.sh` script so it muxes back your original movie's audio to the new movie file.

## Building

Notes before building:

- If on macOS, see below for additional setup notes before building.
- Some static libraries are included for x86 and ARM architectures. These may not be available for your OS+arch combo yet. See Dependencies section below.

### Git submodule

The build depends on the `canvex` subproject which provides 2D graphics rendering. Libraries used by canvex are in a git submodule. You need to run these commands once in the daily-vcs repo root directory:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You should see this message if the init+update is successful:

```
Submodule path 'server-render/canvex/canvex-skia': checked out 'a28e971e1591922036c7745a5bec7a107964d11e'
```

### Building the tool

Vcsrender is a C++ program set up to be built using Meson, a fairly modern multi-language build system which mostly just works. You need to install meson from your package manager (e.g. Homebrew on Mac).

First initialize with:
`meson setup build`

This creates build files in the `build` subdir. You only need to do this once (unless you change the global settings in meson.build files, or upgrade Meson).

You can now build with:
`ninja -C build`

This should place the `vcsrender` binary in the `build` subdir.

At runtime, vcsrender expects to find VCS resources such as fonts in a `res` directory two levels up from `vcsrender`. (I.e. `../../res`.) This matches the structure of the daily-vcs repo. This resource location isn't currently configurable, but will be eventually.

## macOS setup notes

macOS doesn't have the "argp" argument parser library which is standard on Linux. The Mac build therefore needs this dependency from homebrew, in addition to Meson. You can install both with:

`brew install meson argp-standalone`

## Binary dependencies

Vcsrender uses two Google libraries, Skia and libyuv. The Google build chain is complex. To simplify things, we provide these libraries as pre-built static libraries. They are in the git submodule discussed earlier.

- Libyuv library binaries are in `libyuv/lib-static`.
- Skia library binaries are under the canvex subproject.

If your platform is something else than Linux x86-64 or macOS ARM64, we probably don't have pre-built binaries. Sorry! The canvex subproject includes instructions for building Skia. The same instructions can be adapted to build libyuv which is much smaller.

## Running an example

The steps in "Building the tool" above should have put a binary in the subdirectory `build/vcsrender`. Let's give it a try.

Two example videos are provided in `example-data`. We can render a composite of these.

First convert them to YUV sequences:

```
mkdir -p example-data/temp
./convert_movie_to_yuvseq.sh example-data/big-buck-bunny_trim_38s_1m.mp4 example-data/temp/bunny_yuv/bunny
./convert_movie_to_yuvseq.sh example-data/pauli_webcam_example_720.m4v   example-data/temp/webcam_yuv/webcam
```

Create a directory for the output:

```
mkdir -p example-data/temp/testrender_yuv
```

Now run vcsrender with the two inputs:

```
build/vcsrender --oseq example-data/temp/testrender_yuv --duration_frames 300 --iw 1280 --ih 720 --iseq example-data/temp/bunny_yuv --iseq example-data/temp/webcam_yuv
```

In this case, we are providing two input YUV sequences both sized 1280\*720. If the size is different, you can add `--iw` and `--ih` arguments before an `--iseq` to specify. (For describing more complex inputs, see section "Rendering a cut" below.)

Convert the output to a movie:

```
./convert_yuvseq_to_movie.sh example-data/temp/testrender_yuv 1920x1080 24 example-data/temp/testrender.mp4
```

You should now have a 12-second clip (300 frames at 24fps) which shows off some layouts and graphics.

Note that we didn't pass a scene description JSON sequence at all! If you leave the argument empty, vcsrender will use some testing defaults which you can see in the freshly rendered MP4 clip on your disk.

To try passing a scene description JSON sequence, you can use a provided example:

```
build/vcsrender --oseq example-data/temp/testrender_yuv --duration_frames 300 --iw 1280 --ih 720 --iseq example-data/temp/bunny_yuv --iseq example-data/temp/webcam_yuv --jsonseq example-data/batchtest1

./convert_yuvseq_to_movie.sh example-data/temp/testrender_yuv 1920x1080 24 example-data/temp/testrender.mp4
```

## Rendering a cut

A "cut" is a list of edit decisions and motion graphics over time. A separate vcscut tool is provided to convert cuts into a format that can be rendered by vcsrender.

When processing a cut, vcscut will write a file with the `.vcsinputtimings.json` suffix. It describes where each video input starts and stops on the composition's overall timeline.

After processing with vcscut + batch runner, you can use vcsrunner to produce the final output like this:

```
build/vcsrender --oseq example-data/temp/testrender_yuv \
  --input_timings [input timings from vcscut].vcsinputtimings.json \
  --jsonseq [path to batch runner output]

./convert_yuvseq_to_movie.sh example-data/temp/testrender_yuv 1920x1080 24 example-data/temp/testrender.mp4
```

Note how the `--input-timings` argument replaces the `--iseq, --iw, --ih` arguments used in the simple example shown previously. The input timings JSON format describes the inputs completely.

## Known limitations

- YUV frame I/O happens only through file sequences currently. For some workflows it would be more convenient to support stdio so that you could just pipe output to/from ffmpeg.

- Static library binaries are only available on Linux x86-64 and macOS ARM64. (See "Dependencies" above.)
